    File Name:          GetItemFromArray_WW.H

    Function Name:      GetItemFromArray_WW

    Synopsis:           Get item from list, which is expected to be either an
                        address or some other DWORD value.

    Arguments:          pdwWhichItem    = DWORD subscript (offset) into list of
                                          desired item, passed by value

                        plpArray        = LPVOID pointer to first item in list

                        pdwNItems       = DWORD number of items in list, passed
                                          by value

    Returns:            If the function succeeds, the return value is the
                        contents of the DWORD at offset pdwWhichItem in the
                        array at pdwNItems. If the function fails, because
                        pdwWhichItem is out of range, the return value is zero.

                        For C and C++ callers, the return value is cast to
                        LPVOID, and pdwWhichItem follows the semantics for C and
                        C++ arrays.

    Remarks:            A default compilation of a call to this routine yields
                        warning C4047: 'identifier1' : 'operator' : different
                        levels of indirection from 'identifier2' against the
                        second argument, plpArray. Since the warning may safely
                        be ignored, you can safely suppress the warning, as
                        shown in the following example.

                            #pragma warning ( push )
                            #pragma warning ( disable:4047 )
                            lpCurrStr   = GetItemFromArray_WW ( dwSubscript ,
                                                                alpTestStrings ,
                                                                TEST_STRING_COUNT ) ;
                            #pragma warning ( pop )

                        This is the least disruptive way to suppress the warning
                        around this single statement.

                        This routine and its inverse, StoreAddressInArray_WW,
                        are implemented in assembly language, and the object
                        file was generated by the Microsoft Macro Assembler,
                        Version 6.11.

                        Just for fun, I indented the code in the preprocessor
                        blocks.

	Date       By  Synopsis
	---------- --- -------------------------------------------------------------
	2012/01/15 DAG Initial implementation and testing.

    2012/07/03 DAG Based on recently gained knowledge of how various guard code
                   schemes work, move the #pragma once block inside the block
                   protected by the preprocessor guard variable.

    2013/06/18 DAG Eliminate an overlooked reference to CommonConstants_P6C.H
                   and substitute Const_Typedefs_WW.H, which is plenty for a
                   public interface. This update is built into P6CStringLib1,
                   version 2,8,1,0.

    2015/01/15 DAG Change the calling convention from APIENTRY to __stdcall. The
                   effect of this change is confined to this header file. This
                   update is built into P6CStringLib1, version 2,9,0,4.

	2016/01/10 DAG Incorporate the standard three-clause BSD license.
